<p>
Every nerd out there had their moment when they realized that they were a nerd. For some of us that realization came sooner than others. For me, it came when I spent 10 hours straight reading book 7 of Harry Potter. I looked up when done and thought "Boy, am I a nerd".
</p>
What exactly is a nerd? Online definitions fall short, basically saying that nerds are losers. It's definitely more nuanced than that. Boldy, I proclaim that there are 8 different types of nerds. 
<p>
Presenting the exhaustive list of nerd types:
</p>
<p>
<h4>1. Make-believe nerd</h4>
<br/>
This is the classic nerd. Whole swaths of nerds play make believe in various ways, I mean, there's whole factions within this category. You have the D&D nerd, the Trekkie nerd, the Lord of the Rings nerd, cosplay nerds, Potterheads, Magic the Gathering nerds, comic book nerds, board gaming, plus many more. Anyone who obsesses over imagining a more fantastical life is a make-believe nerd. And hey, it's pretty fun (except for Star Trek, that stuff is boring).
</p>
<p>
<h4>2. Fitness nerd</h4>
<br/>
Some people think that if a person is fit, they cannot be nerdy. This misunderstanding arises from the basic high school understanding of nerds. Luckily, we aren't operating at a high school level understanding of nerds, this is PhD level. Fitness nerds obsess over fitness. But don't be mistaken, not all gym rats are fitness nerds. There needs to be a certain ineffable nerdiness musk factor as well. I mean musk in the metaphorical sense. You may be confused at this point and it's probably because you don't know any fitness nerds, but those who know, know, ya know?
</p>
<p>
<h4>3. Eccentric hobby nerd</h4>
<br/>
Simply put, eccentric hobby nerds are so into a single eccentric hobby so much so that they become nerd no matter what else they got going on with their lives. The only stipulation is that these hobbies can't be related to other nerd categories. Here's just some examples: fishing, board games, lawn care, dinosaurs, anime, exotic pets, or collecting cookie jars. They typically know absolutely everything about this one specific hobby and will do this hobby over the course of years.
</p>
<p>
<h4>4. E-sports nerd</h4>
<br/>
Video games have become too mainstream to be a nerd category on its own and so we have the upleveld version, the E-sports nerd. These nerds will not only play an inordinate amount of video games, they will also be head-over-heels into e-sports and most likely Twitch. They've got the gaming chair, the gaming mouse, the gaming keyboard, the gaming energy drinks, the gaming headset, and the gaming arteries. As a positive side effect, these nerds tend to be good drivers due to enhanced hand-eye coordination. They also tend to get irrationally upset if you casually throw the phrase "E-sports aren't real sports" out there or if you frequently get their favorite video game name wrong. (I love me some "League of Nations")
</p>
<p>
<h4>5. Dork nerd</h4>
<br/>
I'm not afraid to admit that I am, in fact, a dork nerd. Dork nerds are the nerds that don't fit cleanly into any other category yet they are still nerd somehow. They are born with the destiny of being nerd. It helps to have some physcial characteristic that marks them as a nerd like say, a big head. Often times, dork nerds are just nerds who are incubating for another category like a baby bird ready to hatch from its egg and take flight into its final nerd category. Fly little dork nerd, fly!
</p>
<p>
<h4>6. Uber nerd</h4>
<br/>
Uber nerds are mythical, much like the unicorn. In theory they exist but a nerd of this stature has yet to be fully documented (to my knowledge). They are the combination of every other nerd category above (but not below). Some say that you become a dork nerd just by being in their presence for longer than 10 minutes. Some also say that they emit an white-gold aura completely blinding to anti-nerds. Nerd prophecy holds that the uber nerds will one day come and elevate world nerdom to the next level.
</p>
<p>
<h4>7. Self-proclaimed nerd</h4>
<br/>
Now we come to the last two categories of nerd, the serfs of the nerd kingdom. The self-proclaimed nerd aren't nerdy at all yet they want to be a nerd which I find oddly... nerdy. They will try and do nerdy things, sometimes imitating make-believe nerds or eccentric hobby nerds yet they're missing the nerdy umph. Still, they often manage to nerd their way into nerdom. 
</p>
<p>
<h4>8. Not nerd nerd</h4>
<br/>
These people are so obsessed with being not nerdy that, counter-intuitively, they become nerdy about being not nerdy. Nerds.

nerds
Fitness nerd: obsess over fitness. Not all gym rats are fitness nerds, there needs to be a certain indescribable nerdiness factor as well
Make-believe nerd: most common type of nerd, think d and d or trekee
Dork nerd: no particular reason why they’re nerdy, they just are. Often but not always are nerds incubating for another category
Eccentic hobby nerd: they are so into a single eccentric hobby so much so that they become nerd no matter what else there is about their lives
Tech nerd: not just a programmer but obsessed with any techy stuff. Must have built their own pc at least.
E-sports nerd: video games are too mainstream to be nerdy on their own. You have to also be legitimately into esports and preferably twitch
Uber nerd: combination of any three of these
Self proclaimed nerd: not really a nerd but the fact that they want to be is oddly… nerdy
Not nerd nerd: so not nerdy that they are nerdy about being not nerdy. Nerd.

There's a lot of power to how we think about ourselves. This is, in fact, the entire basis for the most successful type of depression & anxiety therapy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy">CBT</a>. How we think creates our impression of reality and everyone's impression of reality is, at best, a little bit off. I'd like to show that how we label ourselves can become reality.
<br/>
<br/>
Imagine a person who thinks they are stupid. I know that's rare these days where everyone considers himself or herself a genius either politically or otherwise. But just consider someone who genuinely believes they just don't have the brains to do complicated stuff. That person carries this belief around whether or not it's true, yet that belief influences how the person behaves. He or she will be much less likely to pursue tasks that enhance intelligence. They will learn less, practice less, or study less because "What's the point if I'm dumb?" floats around in the back of their head. When this carries on long enough, that person will in fact become dumb in reality. Not because he or she was destined to be that way genetically but because they believed it to be the case in the first place.
<br/>
<br/>
The same is true but in reverse.
<br/>
<br/>
If you believe yourself a software engineer, then you will pursue tasks that a software engineer would do thus making you a better software engineer. The same is true for any label we may apply to ourselves or others. 
<br/>
<br/>
This is also why, almost across the board, religions tend to label us as something more than just human. Take for example some scriptures from the LDS tradition. When God talks to Moses, he frequently uses the term "my son". He is labeling Moses as something divine. You can imagine how thinking about yourself that way can influence how you act. Shortly after this interaction I'm referencing, Satan interacts with Moses. The devil chooses a different approach frequently calling Moses "son of man", in other words, nothing more than the dust of the earth. (See <a href="https://abn.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/1?lang=eng">here</a> to read the full story of Moses meeting God and then Satan). It's not just the LDS faith that does this. Mainstream Christianity insists that even though we are fallen creatures, we can become angels.
<br/>
<br/>
So all this to say, be careful about labels. Because how you label yourself or loved ones, might actually become true.
