The more I use Jekyll the more I love it. Seriously, it's a blog tool that
puts the focus on blogging. At first the simplicity of it shocked me. Markdown is
hard to get used to but it beats wrestling with clunky text editors. As I've
used Jekyll I've liked it more and more. It's a shame the github pages are
used primarily for programming blogs because Jekyll should be used more. The
only downside is that Obama used it during his campaign. Just kidding. Perhaps
the biggest reason Jekyll is cool is it's ease of hosting. Sometimes all you
need out a blogging tool is a blogging tool.

Wordpress seemed to be the opposite. It gives you a lot more power but it
doesn't feel like it was all planned out from the beginning. It feels like
developers programmed it, then thought of something useful to add to it. Then
programmed that feature, then thought of something else and went on to program
that. Here's a pocket knife meant to do pocket-knifey things but wait, it also
has a compass, and a butter knife, and a diaper changer. To be fair, Wordpress
isn't really seen as a blogger tool but perhaps that's not such a good thing.
Successful businesses have a narrow focus. If Wordpress and Jekyll were new
start-up companies, Jekyll would take off.
